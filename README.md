# Machine Learning Customer Segmentation

Train an unsupervised machine learning algorithm to perform bank customer segmentation. This algorithm could be applied at any marketing department in the banking and retail industries.

### Objectives
- Understand how to leverage the power of machine learning to transform marketing departments and perform customer segmentation
- Apply Python libraries to import and visualize dataset images.
- Understand the theory and intuition behind k-means clustering machine learning algorithm
- Learn how to obtain the optimal number of clusters using the elbow method
- Apply Scikit-Learn library to find the optimal number of clusters using elbow method
- Apply k-means in Scikit-Learn to perform customer segmentation
- Understand the theory and intuition behind Principal Component Analysis (PCA) algorithm
- Compile and fit unsupervised machine learning models such as PCA and K-Means to training data
- Apply Principal Component Analysis (PCA) technique to perform dimensionality reduction and data visualization
